# Objektiv Code Challenge

# Overview

The code challenge is an opportunity to demonstrate proficiency in the problem solving skills we expect you to use on Objektiv.

We don't want to ask you abstract technical questions during an interview, so we have a small challenge for you instead.

Currently we're using React Native throughout our codebase (which is written in ES6).

# Requirements

- Build a react native app with 1 screen implementing the designs contained in the `screenshots` folder
- No validation or API calls are needed
- All state and user input should be stored in redux
- The app should be runnable using expo
- Record a video/gif of you using the app and put it in the `demo` folder`
- Place any info required to run your submission in an `Extra` section in the README

# Timeframe

Take as much time as you need. We're expecting this will take you one or two hours.

# What we're evaluating

- Does README.md contain sufficient information to run the project?
- Does it work?
- How are the components structured?
- How clean is the code?
- Does the end result have a clean user experience?

# Setup
- Fork this repository into your own account
- Make the necessary changes and commit to your repository
- Push the changes to Github

# Submission

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a Compare & pull request button. Click on that button.
Now submit the pull request, selecting `objektivapp/base_expo_rn_repo` as the base fork
